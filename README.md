# grid-world

This repository contains solutions to a 5x5 Gridworld reinforcement learning assignment using various dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Iterative Policy Evaluation**
- **Value Iteration**
- **Policy Iteration**
- **Bellman Optimality**
- **Monte Carlo Exploring Starts**
- **Îµ-soft Monte Carlo Control**
- **Off-Policy Monte Carlo Control with Importance Sampling**

The environment includes:
- Special states: **Blue**, **Green**, **Red**, **Yellow**, and terminal (Black)
- Custom rewards and transitions
- Deterministic and stochastic transitions based on the current state
